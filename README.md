## Scientific Question
(WIP)
- Effects of a certain drug on gene expression?
- Effects of an environmental stressor on gene expression?
- Which genes are expressed more in specific tissues/organs?
- How does COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) stroma cause oncogenesis/tumorigenesis?
  - Potential datasets: https://www.refine.bio/experiments/SRP116952/distinct-cancer-promoting-stromal-gene-expression-depending-on-lung-function and https://www.refine.bio/experiments/SRP125001/multi-omic-molecular-profiling-of-lung-cancer-risk-in-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease
